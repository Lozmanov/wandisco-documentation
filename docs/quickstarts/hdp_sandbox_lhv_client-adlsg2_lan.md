sidebar_label: HDP Sandbox to Azure Databricks with LiveAnalytics
---

Use this quickstart if you want to configure Fusion to replicate from a non-kerberized Hortonworks (HDP) Sandbox to an Azure Databricks cluster.

This will involve the use of Live Hive for the HDP cluster, and the Fusion Plugin for Databricks Delta Lake for the Azure Databricks cluster. These two products form the LiveAnalytics solution.

What this guide will cover:

- Installing WANdisco Fusion using the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool.
- Integrating WANdisco Fusion with Azure Databricks.
- Performing a sample data migration.

Please see the [shutdown and start up](https://wandisco.github.io/wandisco-documentation/docs/quickstarts/hdp_sandbox_fusion_stop_start) guide for when you wish to safely shutdown or start back up the environment.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you will need:

* ADLS Gen2 storage account with [hierarchical namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace) enabled. You will also need:
  * A container created inside this account.
  * Your [Access Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage#view-access-keys-and-connection-string) for the account.
* Azure Databricks cluster with the following credential information:

_These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu LTS._

## Installation

Please log in to your VM prior to starting these steps.

### Setup Fusion

1. Clone the Fusion docker repository to your Azure VM instance:

   `git clone https://github.com/WANdisco/fusion-docker-compose.git`

2. Change to the repository directory:

   `cd fusion-docker-compose`

3. Run the setup script:

   `./setup-env.sh`

4. Enter `y` when asked whether to use the HDP sandbox.


### Startup Fusion

After all the prompts have been completed, you will be able to start the containers:

`docker-compose up -d`

Docker will now download all required images and create the containers, please wait until this is done.

## Configuration

### Install LiveAnalytics on Databricks cluster

Prior to performing these tasks, the Databricks cluster must be in a **running** state. Please access the Azure portal and check the status of the cluster. If it is not running, select to start the cluster and wait until it is **running**.

1. On the docker host, log in to a container for the ADLS Gen2 zone.

   `docker-compose exec fusion-server-adls2 bash`

[//]: <DAP-135 workaround>

2. Upload the LiveAnalytics 'datatransformer.jar' using a curl command.

   `curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" -F contents=@/opt/wandisco/fusion/plugins/live-deltalake/live-analytics-databricks-etl-6.0.0.1.jar -F path="/datatransformer.jar" https://<databricks_service_address>/api/2.0/dbfs/put`

   You will need to adjust the `curl` command so that your [<bearer_token>](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html#generate-a-token) and [<databricks_service_address>](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html#step-2-configure-connection-properties) is referenced.

   _Example values_

   * Bearer Token: `dapibe21cfg45efae945t6f0b57dfd1dffb4`
   * Databricks Service Address: `westeurope.azuredatabricks.net`

   _Example command_

   `curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer dapibe21cfg45efae945t6f0b57dfd1dffb4"  -F contents=@/opt/wandisco/fusion/plugins/live-deltalake/live-analytics-databricks-etl-6.0.0.1.jar -F path="/datatransformer.jar" https://westeurope.azuredatabricks.net/api/2.0/dbfs/put`

   If the command is successful, you will see that the message output contains the following text below:

   ```json
   < HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ```

3. Exit back into the docker host once complete.

   `exit`

4. In your Workspace for the Databricks cluster, on the left-hand panel, select **Clusters** and then select your interactive cluster.

5. Click on the **Libraries** tab, and select the option to **Install New**.

6. Select the following options for the Install Library prompt:

   * Library Source = `DBFS`

   * Library Type = `Jar`

   * File Path = `dbfs:/datatransformer.jar`

7. Select **Install** once the details are entered.

   Wait for the **Status** of the jar to display as **Installed** before continuing.

### Configure the ADLS Gen2

Please ensure to enter your details for the **Storage account**, **Storage container** and **Account Key** values so that they match your account in Azure.
The examples shown below are for guidance only.

    Insert your email address and choose a password. Be sure to make a note of the password you choose.

2. Click on the **Settings** cog in the **ADLS GEN2** zone, and fill in the following details:

* Account Name: `adlsg2storage`

* Container Name: `fusionreplication`

* Account key: `KEY_1_STRING` - the Primary Access Key is now referred to as "Key1" in Microsoftâ€™s documentation. You can get the Access Key from the Microsoft Azure storage account under the **Access Keys** section.

3. Tick the **Use Secure Protocol** box.

4. Click **Apply Configuration**

At this point, OneUI will return to the main page, and there will be a spinning circle where the Settings cog was previously. Wait for that to stop spinning and move on to the next step.

### Check HDP services are started

The HDP sandbox services can take up to 5-10 minutes to start. You will need to ensure that the HDFS service is started before continuing.

1. Log in to the Ambari UI via a web browser.

   `http://<docker_IP_address>:8080`

   Username: `admin`
   Password: `admin`

2. Select the **HDFS** service.

3. Wait until all the HDFS components are showing as **Started**.

### Live Hive activation

1. Go back to the OneUI interface:

   `http://<docker_IP_address>:8081`

2. Click on the **fusion-server-sandbox-hdp** link in the **HCFS HDP** zone. This will open the UI for this zone in a new tab.

3. Click on **Settings -> Live Hive: Plugin Activation**, then scroll back to the top of the page and click **Activate**.

When prompted click the link to reload the page, then go back to the OneUI tab.

### Setup Databricks in Fusion

2. Enter your Databricks Configuration details on the Settings page.

   **Fusion UI -> Settings -> Databricks: Configuration**

   * [Databricks Service Address (Instance name)](https://docs.databricks.com/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-and-id) (Example: `westeurope.azuredatabricks.net`)

   * [Bearer Token](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html#generate-a-token) (Example: `dapibe21cfg45efae945t6f0b57dfd1dffb4`)

   * [Databricks Cluster ID](https://docs.databricks.com/workspace/workspace-details.html#cluster-url) (Example: `0234-125567-cowls978`)

   * [Unique JDBC HTTP path](https://docs.databricks.com/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#construct-the-jdbc-url) (Example: `sql/protocolv1/o/8445611090456789/0234-125567-cowls978`)

   Click **Update** once complete.

## Replication

Follow the steps detailed to perform live replication of HCFS data and Hive metadata from the HDP sandbox to the Azure Databricks cluster.

### Create replication rules

1. Return to the OneUI interface.

    `http://<docker_IP_address>:8081`

2. Click on the plus sign next to **Rules**.

3. Set **Rule Name** to `warehouse`

4. Set **Path for all zones** to `/apps/hive/warehouse`

5. Click **Next** then click **FINISH**.

6. Log in to the Fusion UI for the HDP zone by clicking on the **fusion-server-sandbox-hdp** link. This will open in another tab.

7. Enter the Replication tab, and select to **+ Create** a replication rule.

[//]: <INC-846>

8. Create a new Hive rule using the UI with the following properties:

   On the Replication tab, select to **+ Create** a replication rule again.

   * Type = `Hive`

   * Database name = `databricks_demo`

   * Table name = `*`

   * Description = `Demo` _- this field is optional_

   Click **Create rule** once complete.

9. Both rules should now display on the **Replication** tab in the Fusion UI.

### Test replication

Prior to performing these tasks, the Databricks cluster must be in a **running** state. Please access the Azure portal and check the status of the cluster. If it is not running, select to start the cluster and wait until it is **running**.

1. Return to the terminal session on the **Docker host**.

2. Log in to the **sandbox-hdp** container as the hdfs user and place data into HDFS.

   a. Log in to the container.

   `docker-compose exec -u hdfs sandbox-hdp bash`

   b. Change directory to *tmp*.

   `cd /tmp/`

   c. Obtain the sample data to be used with the Hive table.

   `curl -o customer_addresses_dim.tsv.gz -Lf 'https://github.com/pivotalsoftware/pivotal-samples/blob/master/sample-data/customer_addresses_dim.tsv.gz?raw=true'`

   d. Create a directory within HDFS for the sample data.

   `hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /retail_demo/customer_addresses_dim_hive/`

   e. Place the sample data into HDFS, so that it can be accessed by Hive.

   `hdfs dfs -put customer_addresses_dim.tsv.gz /retail_demo/customer_addresses_dim_hive/`

3. Use beeline to start a Hive session and connect to the Hiveserver2 service as hdfs user.

   `beeline -u jdbc:hive2://sandbox-hdp:10000/ -n hdfs`

   An alternative connection string can also be found on the Ambari UI under **Hive -> Summary -> HIVESERVER2 JDBC URL**.

4. Create a database to use that will store the sample data.

   `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS retail_demo;`

5. Create a table inside of the database that points to the data previously uploaded.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE retail_demo.customer_addresses_dim_hive
   (
   Customer_Address_ID  bigint,
   Customer_ID          bigint,
   Valid_From_Timestamp timestamp,
   Valid_To_Timestamp   timestamp,
   House_Number         string,
   Street_Name          string,
   Appt_Suite_No        string,
   City                 string,
   State_Code           string,
   Zip_Code             string,
   Zip_Plus_Four        string,
   Country              string,
   Phone_Number         string
   )
   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
   STORED AS TEXTFILE
   LOCATION '/retail_demo/customer_addresses_dim_hive/';
   ```

6. Create a second database that will match the regex for the Hive replication rule created earlier in the Fusion UI.

   `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS databricks_demo;`

7. Create a table inside this second database:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE databricks_demo.customer_addresses_dim_hive
   (
   Customer_Address_ID  bigint,
   Customer_ID          bigint,
   Valid_From_Timestamp timestamp,
   Valid_To_Timestamp   timestamp,
   House_Number         string,
   Street_Name          string,
   Appt_Suite_No        string,
   City                 string,
   State_Code           string,
   Zip_Code             string,
   Zip_Plus_Four        string,
   Country              string,
   Phone_Number         string
   )
   stored as ORC;
   ```

[//]: <DAP-223>

8. Now insert data into the table by running the following:

   `insert into databricks_demo.customer_addresses_dim_hive select * from retail_demo.customer_addresses_dim_hive where state_code ='CA';`

   This will now launch a Hive job that will insert the data values provided in this example. If this is successful, you will see **SUCCEEDED** written in the STATUS column.

   ```json
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           VERTICES      STATUS  TOTAL  COMPLETED  RUNNING  PENDING  FAILED  KILLED
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Map 1 ..........   SUCCEEDED      1          1        0        0       0       0
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   VERTICES: 01/01  [==========================>>] 100%  ELAPSED TIME: X.YZ s
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

   The data will take a few moments to be replicated and appear in the Databricks cluster.

### Setup Databricks Notebook to view data

1. Return to your Workspace for the Databricks cluster.

2. Create a Cluster Notebook.

   **Click Workspace on the left hand side > click the drop down arrow > Create > Notebook**

   * Name: **WD-demo**
   * Language: **SQL**
   * Cluster: (Choose the cluster used in this demo)

   Click **Create**.

3. You should now see a blank notebook.

   a. Inside the 'Cmd 1' box, add the query:

   `select * from databricks_demo.customer_addresses_dim_hive;`

   b. Click 'Run Cell' (looks like a play button in the top right of that box).

4. Wait for the query to return, then select the drop-down graph type and choose **Map**.

5. Under the Plot Options > remove all Keys > click and drag 'state_code' from the 'All fields' box into the 'Keys' box.

6. Click Apply.

7. You should now see a plot of USA with colour shading - dependent on the population density.

8. If desired, you can repeat this process except using the Texas state code instead of California.

   a. Back in the Hive beeline session on the **fusion_sandbox-hdp_1** container, run the following command:

   `insert into databricks_demo.customer_addresses_dim_hive select * from retail_demo.customer_addresses_dim_hive where state_code ='TX';`

   b. Repeat from step 3 to observe the results for Texas.

You have now completed this demo.
